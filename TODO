- we should just be able to iterate through all "modules", access a typeInfo+schema+outputDir, and generate the code.
- - this would remove the concept of: query,mutation,combined
- - this will allow us to create entry points + common type folders
- add "name" to the root manifest
- add "displayName" to the meta manifest
- try to reduce changes within schema-bind (excess options being passed in)
